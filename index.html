#### Discuss different types of computer network on the basis of size.

Based on the notes you've provided, here is a discussion of the different types of computer networks classified by size:

1. **Personal Area Network (PAN):** This is the smallest network which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth or wired USB devices, connecting computer peripherals within an individual's workspace.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

3. **Local Area Network (LAN):** A LAN connects network devices over a relatively short distance. A networked office building, school, or home usually contains a single LAN, though sometimes one building will contain a few small LANs, and occasionally a LAN will span a group of nearby buildings.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** A MAN spans a larger area than a LAN and as the name suggests, it covers the area of a city. It is designed to extend over an entire city. It may be a single network such as a cable television network, or it may be a means of connecting a number of LANs into a larger network so that resources may be shared LAN-to-LAN as well as device-to-device.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

1. **Wide Area Network (WAN):** A WAN spans a large geographic area, such as a state, province, or country. WANs often connect multiple smaller networks, such as LANs or MANs. The Internet is the best-known example of a public WAN.
    
5. **Campus Area Network (CAN):** The networks are larger than LANs but smaller than MANs. CANs are often used to connect a variety of LANs within an area that is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN, such as a university campus or corporate campus.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

6. **Storage-Area Network (SAN):** A SAN is a network designed to attach computer storage devices such as disk array controllers and tape libraries to servers. SANs can be accessed in the same fashion as a drive attached to a server.
    
7. **System-Area Network (also known as SAN):** This term is fairly synonymous with the more commonly used term cluster area network. The phrase tends to be used to describe a network that connects high-performance computers with high-speed connections in a cluster configuration.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

Each type of network has its own purpose and context where it is most beneficial, and the choice of network type is dictated by the scale, structure, and requirements of the organization or environment in which it is implemented.

#### What do you mean by network topology? Explain the different types of network topologies.

Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. It defines the structure, design, and layout of the network's components, including its nodes (like computers and network devices) and connecting lines (like cables or wireless signals). The topology determines how the data flows within the network from one device to another, and it can affect the network's performance and scalability.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

Here are the different types of network topologies mentioned in your notes:

1. **Bus Topology:**
    - **Description:** In a bus topology, all computers are connected to a single continuous cable called the 'bus' which acts as the backbone of the network.

####  Differentiate between LAN and WAN.

**Local Area Network (LAN):**

1. **Area Covered:** LANs are designed to cover a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or a building.
2. **Data Transfer Rates:** LANs typically have higher data transfer rates, ranging from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps and even more.
3. **Error Rates:** LANs generally have lower error rates due to the shorter distances and fewer devices involved.
5. **Cost:** Setting up a LAN is less expensive compared to WAN.
6. **Management:** LANs are easier to manage due to their smaller size and the proximity of connected devices.
7. **Ownership:** LANs are usually privately owned.

**Wide Area Network (WAN):**

1. **Area Covered:** WANs cover a large geographic area, which can span cities, states, or even countries and continents.
2. **Data Transfer Rates:** WANs have lower data transfer rates compared to LANs.
3. **Error Rates:** WANs tend to have higher error rates due to the longer distances data must travel and the involvement of multiple networks.
4. **Cost:** Establishing a WAN is more expensive due to the infrastructure required to connect distant locations.
5. **Management:** WANs are more complex to manage and maintain, often requiring specialized staff and equipment.
6. **Ownership:** WANs can be either public or privately owned.

#### Differentiate between Simplex, Half Duplex and Full Duplex.

1. **Simplex Communication:**
    
    - **Description:** In simplex communication, the data transmission is unidirectional. That is, the signal or data can travel in only one direction from the sender to the receiver and not the other way around.
    - **Example:** A good example of simplex communication is a keyboard to a computer, where information is entered from the keyboard into the computer system but does not travel back to the keyboard.

1. **Half Duplex Communication:**
    
    - **Description:** Half duplex allows data transmission in both directions, but not simultaneously. At any given time, the signal can travel in only one direction, which means the devices must take turns when sending and receiving data.
    - **Example:** Walkie-talkies are a classic example of half duplex communication where one person speaks while the other listens and then they switch roles.

3. **Full Duplex Communication:**
    
    - **Description:** Full duplex communication supports data transmission in both directions at the same time. Both the sender and receiver can communicate and send data simultaneously.
    - **Example:** A telephone conversation is an example of full duplex communication where both parties can talk and listen at the same time.

#### Differentiate between internet and intranet.

**Internet:**

1. **Nature:** The Internet is a public network, accessible by anyone around the world.
2. **Users:** Internet users are diverse and may have little to no knowledge about a specific company or organization.
3. **Purpose:** The Internet is mainly used to find out information, communicate, and access a wide range of services.
4. **Content:** It contains a tremendous amount of information on virtually any subject, provided by various sources.
5. **Bandwidth:** The Internet requires higher bandwidth due to the vast amount of data and the global scale of access and communication.
</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
